## Customization

This molecule provides flexibility for customization to suit your application's requirements. Here are some customization options:

### Theme Customization

You can customize the theme colors by modifying the values in the `config.json` file. The theme object contains `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` properties, allowing you to specify the colors according to your brand or design preferences.

```
"theme": {
  "primaryColor": {
    "value": "#ffa500",
    "allowOverride": true
  },
  "secondaryColor": {
    "value": "#1E232C",
    "allowOverride": true
  }
}
```

### Adding Custom Actions

To add custom actions such as registration or additional authentication steps:

- **Review Submission Functionality**: Implement the submission logic within the `handleFeedback` function. You can trigger a submission process with your backend service.

```
const handleFeedback = () => {
  // Implement your registration logic here
};
```

### Updating Component Title
You can update the component title by modifying the `title` value in the `config.json` file.

```
"component": {
  "allowOverride": false,
  "title": "Welcome to Feedback Page!"
}



## Notes

- This molecule does not handle actual submission of rate and review. It simulates the process by displaying a success message upon clicking the submit review button.
- For further customization, you can modify the JSX structure, styles, and functionality according to your application's needs.
